                The iPhone 17 coming in at a price of RM3,999, features an A19 processor, while the three other
                handsets, which are the iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max offer the more powerful
                A19 pro, but coming in at a more expensive price. The cameras have also had a boost across the range, 
                with a new front-facing 18MP Center Stage camera for selfies and video calls. <br><br>

                &emsp;&emsp; All the iPhones for 2025 offer Always-On and ProMotion displays, so 120Hz refresh rates are no longer 
                the domain of the Pro models only. The new iPhone 17 lineup also includes significant internal 
                and external changes and improved battery life across the range.
