                Halide, a third party app, designed by the team at Lux, is a powerful camera
                application that offers advanced camera features, such as manual controls, 
                RAW capture, and depth capture, that are not available in the default camera
                app on the iPhone 17. The app claims to strip away almost all of Apple's built-in
                computational AI features, allowing users to have more control over their photography.

            </div>  

            <p>
                The app offers a range of features, but comes at the cost of RM12 per month 
                or RM80 per year subscription fee, which may be a drawback for some users. 
                However, for photography enthusiasts who want to take their mobile photography 
                to the next level, Halide is definitely worth considering.

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp; One of the standout features of Halide is its manual controls, which allow users 
                to adjust settings such as ISO, shutter speed, and focus manually. This gives 
                users more control over their photography and allows them to capture images 
                that are tailored to their specific needs. The app also offers RAW capture, 
                which allows users to capture images in a higher quality format that retains 
                more detail and allows for more flexibility in post-processing.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp; Overall, Halide is a powerful camera app that offers advanced features and 
                manual controls for iPhone 17 users who want to take their photography to
                the next level. With its intuitive interface and range of features,
                Halide is definitely worth considering for photography enthusiasts.
